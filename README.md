	UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 01: Exploring Weather Trends.
Summary
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends from Lisbon to overall global temperature trends.
The goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the city where I live.
INTRODUCTION:
SQL Query was used to download (CSV) file that contains yearly average temperature of Lisbon and the global temperature.
Then the data has been analyzed using IPython Notebook (Jupyter).
Extract the data :
• Downloading a data files from Udacity's SQL database as CSV.
Create a line chart :
• Calculating the Moving Average (Rolling Average) to make it easier to observe the trends when it be shown in Charts.
• Visualizing the Data in a google spread sheet.
• Analyzing the data.
